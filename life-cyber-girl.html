I am a young girl in her twenties who is making a bit of wave in the cybersecurity field, I love cooking, writing, reading, skating and listening to music. My Cybergirls fellowship experience is one of the best experience I have ever had and it will always remain evergreen in my memory, during the fellowship I was able to interact with different girls from backgrounds, collaborate with some to form a team and went on to deliver mind blowing presentations. It helped me to explore the creative part of myself, improve on my soft skills, think outside the box and made me see things about myself that I never knew was there, to sum it all up, it challenged me to become a better version of myself and let me know that the sky is just the limit. I am currently working as a Junior Penetration Tester at DIgital Encode a Leading Cybersecurity Company in Nigeria. For everyone hoping to join the fellowship, the Cybergirls fellowship is a life changer, it changed my life and the beauty of it all is that you do not have to pay a dime to be a part of this amazing program, all you need is your zeal to learn and an open mind.</p>

I have always been inquisitive about detection, technology, security, and safety so cyber security fits my dream perfectly. I enjoy interacting with people around teaching them how they can stay safe online. I had an amazing and life-changing experience during the training, team work and collaboration were imparted fully to someone like me who enjoys working alone. I am currently not employed but putting my ideas together to paint the bigger picture of cybersecurity to northern Nigerians who are less cyber-aware. I can't tell my cyber story without mentioning the cyber girls' fellowship as it was a starting point and a place of discovery for me. the demand for a cyber security professional to detect, respond and defend from cyber attacks is high and increasing so I encourage females who are passionate about starting a career to join this fellowship as they stand to gain tons of benefits like a detailed and beginner-friendly learning curriculum, mentorship, networking with cyber professional, etc</p>

My fellowship experience is one that’ll stick with me forever because Cybergirls created a safe space for me to expand and discover my latent abilities. We had the honor of being mentored by remarkable women in cybersecurity from around the world, and as a result, we were exposed to knowledge that completely changed my perspective about life and my ability to overcome challenges. One life principle that has resonated with me from CyberGirls is, “With the right mindset, I can do whatever I set my heart to do”. This has helped me to stand out at work and as well as in my personal life, now I am that girl who doesn’t hesitate to spread her wings and soar to new heights. For young females who are reading this and would like to consider a career in cybersecurity, it is simple—YOU CAN DO IT! Nothing is beyond your capacity to handle when you set your mind right! CyberGirls ensures a seamless start to your cybersecurity journey. Good luck!</p>

As I child I have always wanted to become a medical Doctor because I love to protect and take care of people. Along the line Nigeria happened...lol. Few months before I wrote my final exam I heard about Cyber safe Foundation I registered and fortunately I was admitted. I was exposed to a lot I didn't before even though at a point it was really though, I was battling with health issues, my final year project and also being available for my physical training but I didn't give up. At a point in my life during the course of the training I was overwhelmed and didn't know what was paramount in life but all I knew then was that I wanted to balance everything because I already saw a very bright future ahead of me. Yes I didn't because that my dream of protecting, caring and saving the world is actually what I'm doing now. I was determined and it really paid off. Presently I'm interning at a global healthtech company, where I'm exposed to endpoint security detection and responses, phishing simulation, vendor management and so many other. When I look at myself I imagine if I never thought at the stage of life I would be able to achieve all these but Cyber Safe Foundation made it possible. I love to explore and learn new things. I also love to have ideas on everything so I discuss with the rich,poor, young,old and even children.</p>

                            <p class="modal-txt">As a Mathematics student, combining schooling and learning Cybersecurity wasn't easy. It was tough. But, in the end, it was worth it. How I moved from a noob, to a Cybersecurity expert in the space of 9 months was made possible because of the skills applied by CyberSafe Foundation. One thing that helped me so much was access. Mentors, coaches were accessible, even after the program. After the program, I was privileged to work as a junior penetration tester, in a Singapore based company. By virtue of the experience I had in CyberSafe Foundation, which increased my love for and interest in tech, I soon found myself taking tech based certifications, and I'm currently enrolled to study Software engineering. For me, tech has come to stay! This and more wouldn't have been possible if I didn't get the opportunities and privileges I enjoyed at CyberSafe. To everyone still in doubt, as to whether to join or not, please, do yourself this favour and honour, and make up your mind. It's not just about the beginning of your tech journey, but, the beginning/ advancement of your tech journey, with CyberSafe Foundation. It's a rare privilege, I must say! Once a Cyber girl, always a Cyber girl!</p>

I love conducting research and acquiring new knowledge. I'm very interested in advocating for mental health. I transitioned to cybersecurity from hairdressing. Prior to when j was chosen to join the CyberGirls Fellowship, I had wanted to do more for myself and knew I could be more than a commercial hairdresser. I started looking for opportunities that aligned with my aspirations and life purpose, and that's when I stumbled upon the Cybergirls Fellowship. With Cybergirls Fellowship, I had a wonderful journey and gained a new family. There was a great deal of bonding and learning. It gave me a career and helped me restructure my life. I’m currently working as a Cyber Defense Analyst at Esentry Systems Limited. As long as you put your mind to something, there is really no end to what you can accomplish. I learn this daily from Mrs. Confidence Staveley, the Executive Director and Founder of the Cybergirls Fellowship of the Cybersafe Foundation. As new technologies are developed, there is a growing demand for cybersecurity. Try your hardest, and you'll be happy you did.</p>

I am in debt of CyberSafe Foundation because through it, I have met amazing mentors and sponsors who have been investing their time on me and my growth. To anyone who wants to switch to a security IT role, learn extensively, build tough skin and network, then CyberGirls is the perfect place for you. Lastly, iterating my mantra, 'If it is to be, it is up to me', I encourage everyone who will join after me and my 2.0 cohort, to always take initiative and responsibility, of their choices, actions and even steps to becoming their best version of themselves.

                                My name is Ikponke Godwin, from Akwa Ibom State. I’m a proud extrovert and a very expressive person. I love engaging in meaningful conversations especially with light-minded people. I love doing lot of community development projects as a volunteer. Fun things about me!! I love seeing movies, hanging out with my friends, dancing and reading. My experience so far in The fellowship!! When I look at myself six months ago and where I am today, this fellowship has changed everything about me positivity. I see life from a better perceptive, I develop new ways of solving problems, appreciating teamwork, etc. The pattern of learning, the coaches,
mentors and advisers has all collaborated to make the learning process smooth. The bond of sisterhood, friendship we have created will last forever thanks to this fellowship. Right now I work as a volunteer in and non-governmental organization. This training is going to help in my future plans. I have decided to transit from customer service management to Cybersecurity, so it’s a long term goal. This fellowship has laid a strong foundation which I will build on to advance my career. I will use the platform, knowledge and connections gained throughout my stay in the fellowship to advance myself. To people joining the fellowship, CS will always say, when you magnify the excuses, it’s keeps increasing. This is to say, that you will always have an excuse not to push harder, an excuse to break down or give up BUT you also have a reason to push harder still all your dreams come true. I had 100 reasons not to start but look at me today…..I'm a proud Cybergirl. If I can do, You too can.

Fun fact is that I enjoy doing dishes instead of cooking! I do data entry, data analysis for a certain on a short-term contract basis depending on a client’s workflow that means I get to work-from-home.</p>
                            <p> In campus I studied a BSc in Library and Information science where information security was a snippet of my coursework in comparison to what Cybergirls opened my eyes to. That is where I first interacted with the terms Infosec, cybersecurity, cryptography. The nature of my job also brewed up the urge in me to understand how safe the owners of the data we process are, repercussions in case of breach. I go through contracts word by word and I’m intrigued by how much I understand the context now in comparison to when the year began. I appreciate the security measures they put in place and the tools used for protection because I know the effort management has put to it. Other than that, cybergirls has impacted how I keep my word even to myself and how I manage time. Looking back, I realize that everything that was put in place; every person, every resource was well-thought through. Sisters for emotional support, Mentors to hold our hands, Assessments to test our understanding every other week, Presentations, Success advisors and so much more. A perfect program for anyone that is ready for tremendous growth and change as an individual. The training has given me clarity on the direction I want to take careerwise and I look forward to diving into the field of Information security; particularly GRC.</p>

So far, my journey with the CyberGirls fellowship has been rewarding. Prior to joining the fellowship I only had abstract ideas about cybersecurity. I wanted to get into cybersecurity however, I did not know how, and I did not know if it would even be possible for me. Thanks to CyberSafe foundation, this desire has become a reality. Though, it has not been easy. I have been met with an overwhelming amount of resources and information, and sometimes it is difficult to keep up. This does not discourage me, though, since the fellowship is a highly supportive community. I have been given a mentor, and a success advisor, who encourage me to never give up, and are always there for me whenever I need help or advice. Not to mention, I have friends in the fellowship who are always ready to work together with me to help me overcome my problems. Likewise, I have also been able to help them, too. I feel really cared for and valued in the fellowship, and am hoping to use all the training and support I have received from the fellowship to pursue a penetration testing career, in the future. To every girl or woman who wishes to join, I encourage you to go ahead. Nothing is ever easy, but you will never be left alone in your problems when you are in the fellowship. Aside from technical skills, you will also be given training in soft skills such as teamwork and time management. At the end of the day, you will see a massive improvement in your skillset, if you put in the hard work, determination and dedication. I wish you all the best in your journey with the CyberGirls fellowship.</p>

The training has helped me want to change my career and it is giving me a chance to know what I am heading for and what I will be doing. For those that don't know they future plans and those that want to try something else. I'd say try something new and interesting something that is out of your comfort zone there are many opportunities in the world that you can do and CyberGirls is one them, it will open the doors for you to something new and is currently happening to me. It is a great start if you want to be part of Cyber Security and it is a great experience and definitely worth your time.</p>
